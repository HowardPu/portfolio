Here are some of my works you may feel interested to explore more:

Individual Projects:

- [Data visulization for grades for CSE 142/143 at University of Washington between 2005 to 2017](https://github.com/HowardPu/CSE-Data-Analysis)

- Automatical seat resrvation system (based on user preference) for the study room at Changchun Library (in React).
  
  - Since the server for seat selection system is in China, I decide not to put the code into my student server, which is in the US. However, the code is posted in here and can be run by `npm start` once all required packages are installed.

- [Data Analysis for latest battles in Vainglory at given game zone](http://students.washington.edu/howardpu/info/p3-HowardPu/)
