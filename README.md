Here are some of my works you may feel interested to explore more:

Individual Projects:

- [Data visulization for grades for CSE 142/143 at University of Washington](https://github.com/HowardPu/CSE-Data-Analysis)

- Automatical seat resrvation system (based on user preference) for the study room at Changchun Library (in React).
  
  - Since the server for seat selection system is in China, I decide not to put the code into my student server, which is in the US. However, the code is posted in here and can be run by `npm start`.

- [Data Analysis for latest battles in Vainglory at given game zone](http://students.washington.edu/howardpu/info/p3-HowardPu/)

  - Since there ware numerous major updates about `Vainglory api`, current app have some visual giltches, and may needs some refinements.
